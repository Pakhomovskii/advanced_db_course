This project focuses on the design and normalization of a database for an online shop. The goal is to analyze the requirements provided by ABC Company, create the database schema, populate it with test data, and demonstrate its functionality with SQL queries. While the final application may use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, this project will focus exclusively on SQL.
